# Density and Phases of Matter

| Abigail Lee | Period 1 | Chemistry |

**The different densities of solids, liquid, and gases can be explained by differences in the arrangements of their particles of matter.** 

### Density 

The density of most gases is thousands of time smaller than most liquids and solids. 

Compared to solids and liquids the particles of a gas are extremely far apart!

## Important 

*Density (not weight!) determines if something will sink of float.*

* Objects sink in a fluid that is less dense. 
* Objects float in a fluid that is more dense.
